# SU(2) Yang-Mills Plasma KH Simulation — Physics and Implementation Reference

## 1. Physical System

We simulate a **2D (x–z) collisionless plasma** governed by SU(2) Yang-Mills gauge theory. The physical scenario is a **Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability** in a two-beam counterstreaming plasma where the beams carry opposite color charges, creating a non-Abelian electromagnetic background that modifies the KH dispersion relation.

### Configuration (current: NAB_STEP mode)

Two counter-streaming cold plasma beams in a **periodic box** `Lx=6π × Lz=2π`, `NX=768 × NZ=256`:

| Beam | z-velocity (STEP mode) | Color charge Q1 |
|------|------------------------|-----------------|
| A    | +V₀·s(x) | +1 |
| B    | −V₀·s(x) | −1 |

where `s(x)` is the step profile: `+1` for `x<2π` and `x≥4π`, `−1` for `2π≤x<4π`. Grid spacing `DX=DZ=2π/NZ≈0.0245`, `EPS=Lx/6=π` (shear width parameter, used only for tanh modes), `V₀=0.1`, c=ε₀=1.

`kz = k_mode` (integer) exactly, because `Lz=2π` and `dz=2π/NZ`.

### Background Az1 (NAB_STEP)

```
Az1(x) = −V₀ cos(x)     (kx = 1 = 3·2π/Lx, period 2π = Lx/3)
```

This is **frozen** (`freeze_az1=1`): Az1 does not evolve — it is a static prescribed background. Wells (Az1=−V₀, maximum coupling) at x=0,2π,4π align with the velocity interfaces. Peaks (Az1=+V₀) at x=π,3π,5π.

Maximum non-Abelian coupling: `α|Az1|max = α·V₀ = 0.05/TU` (for α=0.5, V₀=0.1). This is bounded and smaller than the WKB growth rate for all k.

## 2. Governing Equations

### 2a. Fluid (FCT advection + source terms)

Each beam evolves via compressible advection with Lorentz and precession sources. Variables: number density n, momentum (p_x, p_z), color charges (Q1, Q2, Q3).

**Continuity:**
```
∂n/∂t + ∇·(nv) = 0
```

**Momentum:**
```
∂p_x/∂t + ∇·(v p_x) = F_x = −Σ_a Q^a (Ex^a + v_z By^a)
∂p_z/∂t + ∇·(v p_z) = F_z = −Σ_a Q^a (Ez^a − v_x By^a)
```

**Color charge precession (non-Abelian Lorentz rotation):**
```
∂Q^a/∂t + ∇·(v Q^a) = α_YM · v_z · (Q × Az)^a
```

where `(Q × Az)^a = ε^{abc} Q^b Az^c` (SU(2) adjoint cross-product):
- `(Q×Az)^1 = Q2·Az3 − Q3·Az2`
- `(Q×Az)^2 = Q3·Az1 − Q1·Az3`
- `(Q×Az)^3 = Q1·Az2 − Q2·Az1`

### 2b. Non-Abelian Maxwell equations

In the A_x=0 gauge (only z-component of vector potential non-zero), the 2D Maxwell equations are:

**Ampere (x-component):**
```
∂Ex^a/∂t = c²(−∂_z By^a − α·(Az×By)^a) − Jx^a/ε₀
```

**Ampere (z-component, no non-Abelian correction in A_x=0 gauge):**
```
∂Ez^a/∂t = c²(+∂_x By^a) − Jz^a/ε₀
```

**Faraday:**
```
∂By^a/∂t = ∂_z Ex^a − ∂_x Ez^a + α·(Az×Ex)^a
```

**Vector potential:**
```
∂Az^a/∂t = −Ez^a     (Az1 frozen for modes 1,3,4)
```

**Currents (both beams, face-averaged to Yee stagger):**
```
Jx^a = −n_A Q^a_A v_{xA} − n_B Q^a_B v_{xB}
Jz^a = −n_A Q^a_A v_{zA} − n_B Q^a_B v_{zB}
```

## 3. Equilibrium Backgrounds

### 3a. NAB_STEP (mode 4) — current active mode

The color-1 sector equilibrium is **prescribed**, not self-consistent:

```
Az1(x) = −V₀ cos(x)           (frozen static background)
By1(x) = ∂_x Az1 = V₀ sin(x)  (not initialized; builds from currents)
```

The cosine Az1 is chosen to: (1) be periodic on Lx/3 matching the 3-fold velocity structure; (2) have wells at velocity interfaces (maximum coupling where the shear is sharpest); (3) be bounded everywhere.

### 3b. NAB_DTANH (mode 3) — double-tanh alternative

Two smooth shear layers at x=L/4 and x=3L/4, with `ξ₁=(x−L/4)/EPS`, `ξ₂=(x−3L/4)/EPS`:

```
vz_A(x) = V₀ (tanh(ξ₁) − tanh(ξ₂) − 1)
Az1(x)  = −V₀ (log cosh(ξ₁) − log cosh(ξ₂))    (frozen)
By1(x)  = V₀ (tanh(ξ₁) − tanh(ξ₂)) / EPS        (gauge-consistent, initialized)
```

### 3c. WKB instability theory (wkb.pdf eq. 33)

The non-Abelian background Az1 modifies the KH eigenvalue problem for the color-2 sector. For a single-tanh Az1 = −V₀ log cosh(ξ), the WKB quantization for fundamental mode (n=0):

```
Q₀ = sqrt(|C₁|)
Q₀ = −γ² − kz² + α² V₀ kz / γ²
|C₁| = α³ V₀² / (2γ²)
```

Key properties (for single-tanh):
- γ increases monotonically with kz (α=0.5, V₀=0.1: k=2→0.049/TU, k=8→0.146/TU in old units)
- Requires the turning points ξ_tp (where α V₀ log cosh(ξ_tp) = sqrt(kz²+γ²)) to lie inside the domain

**Note**: this WKB formula was derived for the single-tanh log-cosh potential. For the cosine Az1 in NAB_STEP, a different quantization condition applies. The step-function velocity also changes the eigenvalue problem. Whether the same instability chain exists for cosine Az1 is to be determined numerically.

## 4. Activation Mechanism for the By2 Instability

Starting from Q2=Q3=0, Az2=Az3=0, the By2 seed activates through:

```
By2 → (∂Ez2/∂t = c²∂_x By2) → Ez2 grows
    → (∂Az2/∂t = −Ez2) → Az2 grows
    → (src_Q3 = α Q1 vz Az2) → Q3 grows
    → (src_Q2 = α Q3 vz Az1) → Q2 grows  ← REQUIRES Az1 ≠ 0
    → (F_z += −Q2 Ez2) → fluid Lorentz force → vz perturbation
    → (Jz2 = n Q2 vz) → modulates Ez2
    → closes the instability loop
```

The critical step is **Q3→Q2**, which requires Az1≠0. In NAB_STEP this is guaranteed by the frozen cosine background.

## 5. Numerical Scheme

### 5a. FCT (Flux-Corrected Transport)

The fluid equations use the **Boris-Book FCT scheme** (`FCT_Sweeps.cu`). FCT is:
- Monotone: no new extrema, positivity of density preserved
- Second-order in smooth regions, first-order at sharp fronts
- Operator-split: x-sweep and z-sweep alternated each step
- z-sweep: transpose → sweep → un-transpose

For periodic x, a ghost-cell padded version `ym_fct_x_sweep_periodic` is used with `NX_PAD=NX+2*FCT_HALO=774` (`FCT_HALO=3`).

### 5b. Non-Abelian Maxwell (finite-difference leapfrog)

Yee-grid staggered leapfrog:
- `Ex` at (x+½, z); `Ez` at (x, z+½); `By` at cell center
- All three colors updated simultaneously per kernel
- Non-Abelian cross-products use local field values (explicit in time)
- Update order: Ampere → Potential → Faraday

### 5c. Source splitting

Lorentz and precession sources are computed at **end of step** using updated fields, applied at **start of next step** inside FCT sweeps. Second-order split between Maxwell solver and FCT advection.

### 5d. Boundary conditions

- **z-direction**: periodic throughout (all modes)
- **x-direction**:
  - Mode 0: reflecting walls — `p_x=0` at x=0 and x=NX−1; `Ez^a=0` at walls
  - Modes 1–4: fully periodic (`(x+NX)%NX` indexing everywhere); periodic FCT x-sweep with ghost cells

## 6. Diagnostics and Output

### Energy diagnostic

```
E_total = Σ_{x,z} [ ½(|Ex|²+|Ez|²+|By|²) + ½(px_A²+pz_A²)/n_A + ½(px_B²+pz_B²)/n_B ]
```

(sum over all 3 colors for each field). Computed every 10000 steps. Written to `ym_k<k>_a<α>_step/energy.csv`. Halt condition: E/E₀ > 100 (modes 3/4) or > 5 (modes 0/1).

### Snapshot CSV

Written every 20000 steps. Columns: `X,Z,By1,By2,By3,Az2,Az3,PzA,PxA,Q1A,PzB,PxB,Q1B`.

By2 is the primary diagnostic field. Az2,Az3 track non-Abelian potential growth. Q1A/Q1B should remain ≈±1 until nonlinear saturation.

### Growth rate extraction

`dispersion_ym.py::growth_rate_from_dir`: FFT By2 in z at each snapshot, extract amplitude of mode k, compute (sech or x-average) weighted average over x, smooth envelope, find maximum R² linear fit in log-amplitude.

## 7. Known Stability Limits

### Old architecture (single-tanh, wall BC — archived)

| Scenario | Lifetime | Cause |
|----------|----------|-------|
| Full-eps Az1 | ~3 TU | α|Az1(edge)|≈6/TU float-noise coupling |
| No-eps Az1, windowed seed | ~63-76 TU | EM wave reaches outer high-coupling region |
| Truncated Az1 |ξ|<3 | ~202 TU | No WKB mode; FCT background instability |
| Any tanh run | ≤202 TU | FCT dissipation of tanh shear → background KH |

### New architecture (cosine Az1, periodic BC)

| Scenario | Expected lifetime | Notes |
|----------|-------------------|-------|
| NAB_STEP mode 4, baseline | ~49 TU | Halts from kz=0 Weibel energy threshold |
| NAB_STEP mode 4, suppress_kz0+hyp_diff | TBD (>49 TU) | No smooth shear → no FCT NaN wall; recommended next run |
| NAB_DTANH mode 3, baseline | ~49 TU | kz=0 Weibel hits 100×E0 threshold |
| NAB_DTANH, suppress_kz0 only | ~46–51 TU | kz=0 leaks through Az/Q channels; still energy-halts |
| NAB_DTANH, suppress_kz0+hyp_diff=5e-5 | ~63–71 TU (FCT NaN) | Weibel suppressed; FCT NaN wall from double-tanh shear |

**Key improvement**: max coupling is `α·V₀=0.05/TU` everywhere in mode 4, vs. unbounded `α·V₀·log cosh(ξ)` in old runs. No outer-region blow-up mechanism.

---

## 8. FCT Blowup — Cause and Mitigation

### Root cause

The FCT NaN wall seen in all NAB_DTANH runs at t=63–71 TU is **FCT advection instability of the smooth double-tanh shear profile**, not a physics instability. The double-tanh velocity `vz(x) = V₀(tanh(ξ₁)−tanh(ξ₂)−1)` has a continuous high-shear gradient over several cells. FCT is monotone in the sense that it prevents new extrema, but under repeated operator-split sweeps (x then z then x…) the shear region accumulates truncation error that eventually produces a NaN in the density floor or momentum divide.

The timing is set by the fluid advection alone (same t_NaN regardless of α, k, or EM coupling strength), confirming it is purely numerical.

### Mitigation options

**Option 1 — Switch to NAB_STEP (mode 4)** *(recommended)*
The step-function velocity `vz = ±V₀` is piecewise constant: no smooth gradient to advect, no FCT accumulation. Campaign 4 (STEP mode, α=2) ran to 49 TU and halted cleanly from the energy threshold, not NaN. With suppress_kz0+hyp_diff, STEP mode should survive far beyond 49 TU. The cosine Az1 provides bounded coupling and the three-fold x-periodicity is fully compatible with the periodic domain.

**Option 2 — Increase hyp_diff**
`hyp_diff=5e-5` extended k=7,8 by ~2.5 TU. To push past 80 TU in DTANH mode would likely require `hyp_diff~5e-4` or larger, which risks damping the KH mode itself (diffusion timescale `1/(hyp_diff·k⁴)` must exceed the KH growth time). Not recommended as the primary path.

**Option 3 — Reduce DT**
The FCT CFL condition is `|v|·DT/DX < 1`. Current DT=0.01·DX gives CFL=0.01·V₀=0.001 — far below the limit. Reducing DT further would not help since the instability is not a CFL violation; it is error accumulation over many steps.

**Option 4 — Add velocity sponge at shear layers**
Damp `vz` back toward equilibrium in the high-shear region at each step. This is physical damping of the shear flow and suppresses the background KH that the FCT instability seeds, but also changes the equilibrium. Not implemented; would require a new source term in the fluid kernel.

**Option 5 — Artificial smoothing of the initial profile**
Initialize with a slightly wider shear layer (larger EPS). A wider tanh is better-resolved on the grid and FCT-stable for longer. The WKB eigenfunction width scales with `1/sqrt(α·V₀/EPS)`, so widening EPS also changes the quantization levels.

### NAB_STEP ruled out (Campaigns 7, 9)

NAB_STEP was tested in Campaigns 7 and 9 (α=2, suppress_kz0=1, hyp_diff=5e-5). All k values blew up at t≈12–22 TU from a **color-1 two-stream instability**. In NAB_STEP, both beams have |vz|=V0 everywhere, so the opposite-color beams (Q1=±1, vz=±V0) create a full-domain two-stream configuration with growth rate ω_p/√2 ≈ 0.7 TU⁻¹. Independent of α — cannot be fixed by any EM filter.

### Current solution: NAB_TANH_COSAZ (mode 5) + DFT fluid pz filter

Mode 5 combines the bounded cosine Az1 of NAB_STEP (no outer-region blowup) with a tanh velocity profile (vz→0 at the shear interface). The residual outer-region two-stream at kz=1..14 is suppressed each step by `kernel_fluid_pz_subtract_kz_range` zeroing those DFT modes from pzA and pzB. The same kz range is also zeroed in the color-2/3 EM fields by `kernel_ym_subtract_kz_range`.

With this setup (Campaign 12, EPS=0.15, α=2, BP=14):
- E/E0 stays flat through t≥5 TU (no two-stream growth)
- Run speed: ~9,200 steps/min on RTX A5000
- KH mode at target kz is the only growing perturbation in the system
